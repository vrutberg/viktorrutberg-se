&lt;p&gt;How often have you been tasked with adding a modal takeover view to an iOS app? You know, one of those views that are supposed to appear when the user launches the app, “on top of everything else”. It’s a common ask, and it can be useful to present something to the user right away. Some examples from my experience include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Time to update!’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘What’s new in this version’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Is this contact information still correct?’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passcode verification when opening the app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display some view because the user opened the app using a deep link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementing the actual views for these use cases is one thing, but making sure that they appear at the correct time is another. If we just have one of these modal views, it’s simple: just present it after the app has been launched. But what happens when we want to show multiple modal views upon app launch? Out of the examples above, what happens if the user has passcode verification enabled in the app, opens the app through a deep link, and has just upgraded the app?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
